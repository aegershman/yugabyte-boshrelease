# yugabyte-boshrelease

This is a [BOSH](http://bosh.io/) release for [YugabyteDB](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db).

## ysql caveats

This currently only supports `YEDIS` and `YCQL` compatibilities. Enabling `YSQL` is something which will be worked on eventually, however other features like TLS, encryption, auth, and testing with `YCQL` and `YEDIS`, etc., are taking priorty.

## contributing

Ideas, feedback, bug reports, etc. are all welcome, _but_ by no means guaranteed to be implemented, responded to, or merged.
