  rpc_bind_addresses_port:
    description: |
      For the time being, this value is used for both "rpc_bind_addresses" and "server_broadcast_addresses"
      If you're deploying yugabyte universes under a bosh director which has other deployments, such as metrics scrapers,
      performing periodic rpc calls on port `:9100`, the tserver nodes will interpret those rpc calls as malformed requests from another `tserver`;
      this causes the tserver to explode and die.
      Given the likelihood that anyone deploying this is deploying it under a bosh director which is leveraging a metrics scraper,
      the default `tserver_rpc_bind_port` will be set to `:9101`.
      You really shouldn't notice a difference about any of this at all, but it's worth pointing out since it's a delta between what's shipped stock with upstream OSS YB.
    default: 9101
  post_start_delay:
    description: |
      time delay in seconds to wait after startup before the lifecycle reports healthy,
      i.e., after the yugabyte process reports healthy, then wait an additional
      "post_start_delay"-seconds before BOSH marks the lifecycle as complete.
      this is helpful for giving some slack to yugabyte processes to give some
      extra time to join quorum and such. this is currently being set based off of the guidance of
      yugabyte's "upgrade-deployment" documentation, and thus erring on the side of cautious.
      but if you wanted you could set this to 0 and just see what happens. if you do that,
      please let us know how it works out and if you see any problems.
      until then, the default will be the recommended 60 seconds.

  gflags:
    description: extra "--key=value" properties to pass to the conf file
    example:

  yb_num_shards_per_tserver:
    description: |
      The number of shards per YB-TServer for each YCQL table when a user table is created.
      Default: -1 (server internally sets default value).
      For servers with two or less CPU cores, then the default value is 4.
      For four or more CPU cores, the default value is 8.
      Local cluster installations, created using yb-ctl and yb-docker-ctl, use a value of 2 for this option.
      IMPORTANT: This value must match on all yb-master and yb-tserver configurations of a YugabyteDB cluster.
    default: -1
  ysql_num_shards_per_tserver:
    description: |
      The number of shards per YB-TServer for each YSQL table when a user table is created.
      NOTE: On a per-table basis, the CREATE TABLE ...SPLIT INTO clause can be used to override the ysql_num_shards_per_tserver value.
      IMPORTANT: This value must match on all yb-master and yb-tserver configurations of a YugabyteDB cluster.
    default: 8

  durable_wal_write:
    description: |
      If set to false, the writes to the WAL are synced to disk every interval_durable_wal_write_ms milliseconds (ms)
      or every bytes_durable_wal_write_mb megabyte (MB), whichever comes first.
      This default setting is recommended only for multi-AZ or multi-region deployments where the availability zones (AZs)
      or regions are independent failure domains and there is not a risk of correlated power loss.
      For single AZ deployments, this option should be set to true.
    default: false
  interval_durable_wal_write_ms:
    description: When --durable_wal_write is false, writes to the WAL are synced to disk every --interval_durable_wal_write_ms or --bytes_durable_wal_write_mb, whichever comes first.
    default: 1000
  bytes_durable_wal_write_mb:
    description: When --durable_wal_write is false, writes to the WAL are synced to disk every --bytes_durable_wal_write_mb or --interval_durable_wal_write_ms, whichever comes first.

    default: cassandra
  ycql.cassandra_password_old:
    description: |

    default: cassandra
  ycql.databases.superusers:
    description: |
      until we get to putting a more fine-grained RBAC model in place
      on startup, we'll just assume every created user is a superuser
      https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/api/ycql/ddl_alter_role/
    example: |

            - name: hank_hill
              password: propane_bwaaah

  placement_cloud:

      placement_region: centralus
  placement_zone:
    description: |
      Override the name of the availability zone, or rack, where this instance is deployed.
      Keep in mind, this is just the _name_ of the placement_zone of how Yugabyte sees it,
      it won't affect the actual placement of the node. It's best if you DON'T TOUCH THIS
      because BOSH can figure out the 'spec.az' of a given instance on it's own.
      Default is handled by BOSH.

  default_memory_limit_to_ram_ratio:
