  rm_post_install_completed_on_startup:
    description: |
      Remove the ".post_install.sh.completed" file marker on app startup before the "post_install.sh" script runs again
      in order to re-initialize any packaging
    default: false
  enable_manual_ysql_init:
    description: |
      Manually perform a postgres initdb to initialize system tables. This is valuable when enabling ysql on a universe
      which didn't previously have ysql enabled when the universe was created.
    default: false

  rpc_bind_addresses_port:
    description: for the time being, this value is used for both "rpc_bind_addresses" and "server_broadcast_addresses"
    default: 7100
  post_start_delay:
    description: |
      time delay in seconds to wait after startup before the lifecycle reports healthy,
      i.e., after the yugabyte process reports healthy, then wait an additional
      "post_start_delay"-seconds before BOSH marks the lifecycle as complete.
      this is helpful for giving some slack to yugabyte processes to give some
      extra time to join quorum and such. this is currently being set based off of the guidance of
      yugabyte's "upgrade-deployment" documentation, and thus erring on the side of cautious.
      but if you wanted you could set this to 0 and just see what happens. if you do that,
      please let us know how it works out and if you see any problems.
      until then, the default will be the recommended 60 seconds.

    default: 60

  tls.use_node_to_node_encryption:
    description: |
      set to true to enable encryption between nodes
      see also: https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/secure/tls-encryption/server-certificates
    default: true
  tls.allow_insecure_connections:
    description: |
      set to false to disallow any service with unencrypted communication from joining this cluster.
      note that the use of "allow_insecure_connections" on master nodes refers to services (e.g. tservers)
      joining the cluster, whereas "allow_insecure_connections" on tserver nodes refers to clients
      (e.g. actual applications) trying to talk to the cluster.
    default: false

    description: "CA root required for key/cert verification"
  tls.node.cert:
    description: "TLS certificate for this node"
  tls.node.key:

  gflags:
    description: extra "--key=value" properties to pass to the conf file
    example:
      gflags:
        log_change_config_every_n: 1

  yb_num_shards_per_tserver:
    description: |
      The number of shards per YB-TServer for each YCQL table when a user table is created.
      Default: -1 (server internally sets default value).
      For servers with two or less CPU cores, then the default value is 4.
      For four or more CPU cores, the default value is 8.
      Local cluster installations, created using yb-ctl and yb-docker-ctl, use a value of 2 for this option.
      IMPORTANT: This value must match on all yb-master and yb-tserver configurations of a YugabyteDB cluster.
    default: -1
  ysql_num_shards_per_tserver:
    description: |
      The number of shards per YB-TServer for each YSQL table when a user table is created.
      NOTE: On a per-table basis, the CREATE TABLE ...SPLIT INTO clause can be used to override the ysql_num_shards_per_tserver value.
      IMPORTANT: This value must match on all yb-master and yb-tserver configurations of a YugabyteDB cluster.
    default: 8

  durable_wal_write:
    description: |
      If set to false, the writes to the WAL are synced to disk every interval_durable_wal_write_ms milliseconds (ms)
      or every bytes_durable_wal_write_mb megabyte (MB), whichever comes first.
      This default setting is recommended only for multi-AZ or multi-region deployments where the availability zones (AZs)
      or regions are independent failure domains and there is not a risk of correlated power loss.
      For single AZ deployments, this option should be set to true.
    default: false
  interval_durable_wal_write_ms:
    description: When --durable_wal_write is false, writes to the WAL are synced to disk every --interval_durable_wal_write_ms or --bytes_durable_wal_write_mb, whichever comes first.
    default: 1000
  bytes_durable_wal_write_mb:
    description: When --durable_wal_write is false, writes to the WAL are synced to disk every --bytes_durable_wal_write_mb or --interval_durable_wal_write_ms, whichever comes first.
    default: 1

  stop_on_parent_termination:
    description: When specified, this process will terminate when parent process terminates. Linux-only.
    default: true

  placement_cloud:
    description: Specifies the name of the cloud where this instance is deployed.
    default: cloud1
    example:
      placement_cloud: azure
  placement_region:
    description: Specifies the name of the region, or data center, where this instance is deployed.
    default: datacenter1
    example:
      placement_region: centralus
  placement_zone:
    description: |
      Override the name of the availability zone, or rack, where this instance is deployed.
      Keep in mind, this is just the _name_ of the placement_zone of how Yugabyte sees it,
      it won't affect the actual placement of the node. It's best if you DON'T TOUCH THIS
      because BOSH can figure out the 'spec.az' of a given instance on it's own.
      Default is handled by BOSH.

  default_memory_limit_to_ram_ratio:
    description: |
      If memory_limit_hard_bytes is left unspecified, then it is
      set to default_memory_limit_to_ram_ratio * Available RAM.
    default: 0.85

  logtostderr:
    description: |
      Write log messages to stderr INSTEAD OF logfiles.
      When this is "true", there won't be logs visible through the node UI.
    default: false
  max_log_size:
    description: "The maximum log size, in megabytes (MB). A value of 0 will be silently overridden to 1."
    default: 1800 # 1.8 GB
  minloglevel:
    description: "The minimum level to log messages. Values are: 0 (INFO), 1 (WARN), 2 (ERROR), 3 (FATAL)."
    default: 0
  stderrthreshold:
    description: |
      Log messages at, or above, this level are copied to stderr in addition to log files.
      Basically it tees error logs to both the log file directory and stderr.
      Values are: 0 (INFO), 1 (WARN), 2 (ERROR), 3 (FATAL).
    default: 2
  stop_logging_if_full_disk:
    description: Stop attempting to log to disk if the disk is full.
